# ConvexHulls

Convex hull algorithms written in different languages. This is a little project of mine that I tackle when learning new programming languages, as the complex hull challenge covers a lot of the basics for each language. I do not claim that any of this is by any means optimized, but to my knowledge the completed languages work.
